# Hivekeep system prompt construction

This document specifies how the system prompt is assembled before each LLM call for an Agent.

It describes what the **code actually does**, not an idealized design. The source of truth is `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts` (the assembly), `src/server/services/llm-cache-hints.ts` (how the segments reach the provider), and `src/server/tools/register.ts` (the live native-tool inventory). When this doc and those files disagree, the files win.

> **Language convention**: all prompt templates are written in English as the base language. The Agent adapts its reply language from the `## Language` block, which is rebuilt every turn from the current speaker's profile.

---

## 1. The big picture

`buildSystemPrompt(params: PromptParams): BuiltSystemPrompt` does not return one string. It returns a pair:

```ts
interface BuiltSystemPrompt {
  stable: string    // rarely-changing prefix (identity, principles, instructions, directory, MCP/channels)
  volatile: string  // per-turn content (memories, contacts, speaker, summaries, language, workspace, date)
}
```

The split exists for **Anthropic prompt caching**. The two segments are placed differently when the request is built (`buildSegmentedMessages` in `llm-cache-hints.ts`):

- `stable` becomes the actual `system` text block, marked with a cache breakpoint (`cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' }`). It is the long-lived cached prefix.
- `volatile` is **not** appended to the system prompt. It is wrapped in a `<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>` block and prepended to the **last user message's** content. Putting the per-turn content after the cached prefix (rather than inside it) keeps the cache from being invalidated every turn by date/time, memories, and other volatile blocks.

`joinSystemPrompt(p)` concatenates `${stable}\n\n${volatile}` back into a single string. It is used only by callers that don't care about caching (token estimation, the context-preview UI). The real LLM path (`agent-engine.ts`, `tasks.ts`) goes through `buildSegmentedMessages`, never `joinSystemPrompt`.

So the full request sent to `LLMProvider.chat()` is:

```
system:   [ {text: <stable>, cache breakpoint} ]
messages: <compacted history is already folded into the prompt, see §6 [9]>
          <recent messages, with cache breakpoints (BP3/BP4) on the right anchors>
          <last user message = <system-reminder>{volatile}</system-reminder> + original content>
tools:    <provider-native tool schemas, resolved from the Agent's toolboxes>
```

> Tools are NOT listed in the textual prompt. They are passed via the provider's native `tools` parameter (the Vercel AI SDK was removed pre-2.0). Native primitives now live under `src/server/llm/{llm,embedding,image,search,stt,tts,core}/`. The prompt only *references tools by name* inside instruction blocks; it never enumerates a tool list.

---

## 2. The `toolsEnabled` gate

`const toolsEnabled = params.toolsEnabled !== false` (prompt-builder.ts:972).

When the resolved model cannot tool-call (`LLMModel.maxTools: 0`, e.g. some Replicate completion models), the engine passes `toolsEnabled: false`. This is computed in `agent-engine.ts` via `getMaxToolsForRequest(...) > 0`.

When `toolsEnabled` is false, the builder **omits** every tool-usage section: `## Tool calling discipline`, the `## Internal instructions` mega-block, and the `## MCP Tools` summary. Without an actual tool channel, leaving that guidance in just teaches the model to emit JSON tool-call syntax as plain text.

Defaults to `true` for legacy compatibility (every built-in provider supports tools).

---

## 3. The three prompt shapes

`buildSystemPrompt` branches into three distinct shapes:

| Shape | Condition | Roughly |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Main Agent** | `else` branch (not sub-Agent, not quick session) | ~27 blocks |
| **B. Sub-Agent (task)** | `isSubAgent && taskDescription` | ~16 blocks |
| **C. Quick session** | `isQuickSession` (returns early) | 5 blocks |

Each block below is tagged `[stable]` or `[volatile]` exactly as the code segments it. The legacy `[n]` block numbers are kept in code comments and shown here in parentheses for cross-reference, but they are not contiguous and do not match emission order. Treat the order in the tables as authoritative.

### A. Main Agent prompt (prompt-builder.ts:1088–1163 + shared tail 1202–1647)

| # | Block (heading) | Seg | Fed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `## Platform context` (`[0]`) | stable | hardcoded | continuous session, multi-user, queue model |
| 2 | `You are {name} (slug: {slug}), {role}.` (`[1]`) | stable | `agent.name/slug/role` | identity line |
| 3 | `## Core principles` (`[1.5]`) | stable | hardcoded | universal baseline behaviors |
| 4 | `## Tool calling discipline` (`[1.6]`) | stable | hardcoded, gated on `toolsEnabled` | anti-pre-narration + concrete anti-pattern + image-embedding sub-block |
| 5 | `## Personality` (`[2]`) | stable | `agent.character` (if set) | injected verbatim, no translation |
| 6 | `## Expertise` (`[3]`) | stable | `agent.expertise` (if set) | injected verbatim |
| 7 | `## Platform directives` (`[3.5]`) | stable | `globalPrompt` (if set) | the admin-set global prompt (see §4) |
| 8 | `## Configurator mission` + `## Hivekeep knowledge` (`[3.6]`) | stable | `agent.kind === 'configurator'` | Queenie only (see §5) |
| 9 | `## Known contacts` | volatile | `contacts[]` | shared registry, with aka/system-user/identifier summary |
| 10 | `## Agent directory` + Collaboration & delegation | stable | `agentDirectory[]` | main-agent variant |
| 11 | `## Memories` (full code heading: `Memories · what you actually know`) | volatile | `relevantMemories[]` | scored, grouped, relevance/importance legend (see §6 [5]) |
| 12 | `## Relevant knowledge` | volatile | `relevantKnowledge[]` | knowledge-base chunks |
| 13 | `## Internal instructions (do not share…)` | stable | hardcoded, gated on `!isSubAgent && toolsEnabled` | large block; project-knowledge sub-section only when `activeProject` is set |
| 14 | `## MCP Tools (external servers)` | stable | `mcpTools[]`, gated on `toolsEnabled` | one summary line per server (counts only) |
| 15 | `## External channels` + platform formatting guide | stable | `activeChannels[]` | Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack/Web formatting rules |
| 16 | `## Current speaker` | volatile | `currentSpeaker{}` | name, role, shared/user/private notes, priority-onboard prompt when unknown |
| 17 | `## Active participants` | volatile | `participants[]` | group vs 1:1 hint |
| 18 | `## Conversation state` | volatile | `conversationState{}` | visible/total counts, compaction awareness |
| 19 | `## Conversation history summaries` | volatile | `compactingSummaries[]` | see §6 [9] |
| 20 | `## Language` | volatile | `userLanguage` | per-speaker |
| 21 | `Current message from: **{platform}**` hint | volatile | `currentMessageSource{}` | one-line origin + per-platform formatting reminder |
| 22 | `## Channel origin context` | volatile | `pendingChannelContext{}` | reply auto-delivered back to the originating channel |
| 23 | `## Workspace` (+ file tree) | volatile | `workspacePath` → `generateWorkspaceTree()` | depth-limited tree |
| 24 | `## Active project` | volatile | `activeProject{}` | knowledge index/pinned, open tickets, tags (see §7) |
| 25 | `## Current plan` (task_todos) | volatile | `taskTodos[]` | rare on main; primary on sub-Agents |
| 26 | `## Context` | volatile | `buildContextBlock()` | date/time/tz/version/install/RAM/uptime (see §6 [8]) |
| 27 | `## Final reminder (most important rule of this turn)` | volatile | hardcoded | recency-positioned tool-discipline tie-breaker |

### B. Sub-Agent (task) prompt (prompt-builder.ts:974–1087 + shared tail)

| # | Block | Seg | Fed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `You are {name}, a specialized AI agent on Hivekeep, executing a delegated task.` | stable | `agent.name` | + one line on what Hivekeep is |
| 2 | `## Your mission` | stable | `taskDescription` | |
| 3 | `## Ticket assignment` | stable | `ticketAssignment{}` | project context, ticket, task history, comments, run-prompt, project knowledge (see §7) |
| 4 | `## Environment` | stable | `systemContext{}` | platform/arch/available CLIs + workspace cwd; saves probe calls |
| 5 | `## Constraints` + `## Tool calling discipline` + `## Execution discipline` + `## CRITICAL - Task resolution` | stable | hardcoded | ticket vs non-ticket variants; cron-journal addendum when it's a cron task |
| 6 | `## Previous runs` | stable | `previousCronRuns[]` | cron continuity (newest first) |
| 7 | `## Learnings from previous runs` | stable | `cronLearnings[]` | accumulated lessons |
| 8 | `## Platform directives` | stable | `globalPrompt` | global prompt applies to sub-Agents too |
| 9 | `## Known contacts` | volatile | `contacts[]` | **injected**: sub-Agents DO see contacts |
| 10 | `## Agent directory` + Inter-Agent comms + Escalation | stable | `agentDirectory[]` | sub-Agent variant; references `send_message`/`list_kins` |
| 11 | `## Memories` | volatile | `relevantMemories[]` | same renderer as main |
| 12 | speaker / participants / state / summaries / language / message-hint / channel / workspace | mixed | shared tail | same blocks as main (only those with data render) |
| 13 | `## Active project` | volatile | `activeProject{}` | if passed |
| 14 | `## Current plan` (task_todos) | volatile | `taskTodos[]` | primary use case: the live plan, re-shown every turn |
| 15 | `## Context` | volatile | `buildContextBlock()` | |
| 16 | `## Final reminder (this turn)` | volatile | hardcoded | execution-efficiency variant (don't re-read, fan out, no shell wrappers, no safety bypass) |

> The sub-Agent shape skips: `## Platform context`, `## Core principles`, `## Personality`, `## Expertise`, the main-agent `## Internal instructions` mega-block, and the `## MCP Tools` / `## External channels` summaries. Its discipline blocks are inlined into the `## Constraints` group instead.

### C. Quick session prompt (prompt-builder.ts:1166–1200)

Returns early. Order: `## Memories` (if any, volatile) → `## Platform directives` (if set, stable) → `## Quick session` notice (stable) → `## Language` (volatile) → `## Context` (volatile). Skips contacts, agent directory, internal instructions, and MCP. Quick sessions are stateless one-offs with no main conversation history, no inter-Agent comms, and no admin tools.

---

## 4. The global prompt (`## Platform directives`)

An admin-set, platform-wide instruction block (`app_settings`, read/written via the `get_global_prompt` / `set_global_prompt` tools). Injected into all three shapes when non-empty, in the **stable** segment. Use it for conduct rules every Agent must follow ("anything all your Agents should respect?"). Queenie proposes and edits it during onboarding.

---

## 5. The Queenie configurator block

When `agent.kind === 'configurator'` (the seeded onboarding Agent, Queenie), the main-Agent shape appends a stable block built by `buildConfiguratorBlock()`:

- `## Configurator mission`: a hardcoded onboarding playbook (assess-before-asking, one thing at a time, secrets via secure-input popups never chat, reuse keys across capabilities, avatar style/subject/base, the global prompt, and the full setup checklist).
- `## Hivekeep knowledge`: loaded once (and cached) from `src/server/assets/queenie-knowledge.md`, so Queenie can answer "what can Hivekeep do?" without guessing.

The configurator-only tools (`describe_provider_config`, `request_provider_setup`, `prompt_secret`, `enable_provider_capability`, `set_default_*`, `get/set_global_prompt`, the `*_avatar_*` family, `test_channel`, `request_channel_setup`) live in the `system` tool family and are granted through Queenie's permanent toolbox. See `queenie.md` for the full configurator spec.

---

## 6. Selected block details

### [1.6] Tool calling discipline (stable, main; inlined for sub-Agents)

Strong anti-pre-narration rule modeled on Claude Code's `IMPORTANT:` pattern, with explicit forbidden-phrase examples and a concrete BAD/GOOD anti-pattern. Necessary because personality blocks often push warm/conversational tones that fight terse tool discipline. Includes an **Embedding images** sub-block: tools that return an image URL should be embedded with `![alt](url)` markdown so the chat renderer shows them inline with click-to-zoom.

### [5] Memories: `buildMemoriesBlock` (volatile)

Long-term memories retrieved by hybrid search for the incoming message. Rendering adapts:
- ≤3 memories → flat list.
- ≥60% have a subject → grouped by subject (most natural for the LLM).
- Otherwise → grouped by category (Facts/Preferences/Decisions/Knowledge).

Each line carries indicators: `★` (importance ≥7), relevance tags `⬤`/`◉`/`○` (from the retrieval score, normalized against the top score), `[category]`, `*[shared by {agent}]*` for shared memories, subject, source context, and a relative timestamp. A `config.memory.tokenBudget` (when set) trims the lowest-relevance memories first. The header tells the Agent to weight `⬤`/`★` highest, prefer recent on conflict, and weave them in naturally.

### [8] Context: `buildContextBlock` (volatile)

Rebuilt every turn. Emits: current date (weekday + full date), current time + timezone, ISO timestamp, a timezone-interpretation note, `Platform: Hivekeep v{config.version}`, installation type (Docker / systemd-user / systemd-system / manual, with user and config-file path when known), data directory, public URL, and a live system line (`{platform} {release} ({arch}) | Uptime: … | RAM: used/total GB`). All wall-clock times render in `config.timezone`.

### [9] Conversation history summaries (volatile)

When older messages have been compacted, their summaries are injected as a `## Conversation history summaries` block in the **volatile** segment of the system prompt content (i.e. inside the `<system-reminder>` on the last user message). They are NOT a separate `role:"system"` message in the history. Each summary is rendered with its date range and a `[compressed]` flag when re-summarized (`depth > 0`). The block points the Agent at `list_summaries`/`read_summary` and `browse_history`/`search_history` to dig further back. Source: `compactingSummaries` rows with `isInContext = true`, gathered in `agent-engine.ts:buildMessageHistory`. See `compacting.md` for how summaries are produced.

### Recent messages and message prefixing

Recent (not-yet-compacted) messages go into the `messages` array as-is, with their original role. Each is prefixed with its sender's identity so the Agent can address the right person:

| Source | Prefix |
|---|---|
| User | `[{pseudonym}]` |
| Other Agent | `[Agent: {name}]` (+ request/inform/reply + request_id when applicable) |
| Task result | `[Task: {description}] Result:` (ticket-linked tasks append the linked-ticket reminder) |
| Cron result | `[Cron: {name}] Result:` |
| request_input reply | `[Parent response]:` |

The volatile `<system-reminder>` (per §1) is prepended to the **last user message** specifically.

---

## 7. Project context blocks

Two surfaces share the same project-knowledge renderer (`renderProjectKnowledgeBlock`): the main Agent's `## Active project` block and the sub-Agent's `## Ticket assignment` block. Knowledge is project-scoped, so both show the same content.

- **`## Active project`** (main, volatile): title, slug, GitHub URL, description (truncated past `config.projects.maxDescriptionPromptTokens`, default 8000), tags, the project-knowledge section, and open non-`done` tickets (capped at `config.projects.maxTicketsInPrompt`, default 50, sorted `updated_at DESC`). Omitted entirely when there is no active project.
- **`## Ticket assignment`** (sub-Agent, stable): injected when the task is linked to a ticket. Adds project context, the ticket itself, prior task history on the same ticket, existing comments, an optional run-specific sur-prompt, and the project-knowledge section. Always derived from the live ticket at build time (never a frozen snapshot), except the knowledge index/pinned bodies which are snapshotted at spawn for cache stability.

Project-knowledge rendering: **pinned** entries (cap `config.projectKnowledge.pinCap`, default 10) inline their full markdown body; everything else appears as a title-only index (pinned entries flagged `✦`) the Agent can fetch on demand with `get_project_knowledge(id)` or discover with `search_project_knowledge(query)`.

---

## 8. The `PromptParams` shape

The builder takes a single `~30`-field params object. Rather than restating it (it drifts), read `PromptParams` in `prompt-builder.ts` (lines 91–184). The fields, grouped:

- **Identity / mode**: `agent { name, slug, role, character, expertise, kind }`, `isSubAgent`, `isQuickSession`, `taskDescription`, `toolsEnabled`.
- **Knowledge & people**: `contacts`, `relevantMemories`, `relevantKnowledge`, `agentDirectory`, `currentSpeaker`, `participants`.
- **Conversation**: `compactingSummaries`, `conversationState`, `currentMessageSource`, `pendingChannelContext`, `userLanguage`.
- **Platform**: `globalPrompt`, `mcpTools`, `activeChannels`, `workspacePath`.
- **Projects / tasks**: `activeProject`, `ticketAssignment`, `taskTodos`.
- **Sub-Agent extras**: `systemContext`, `previousCronRuns`, `cronLearnings`.

```ts
function buildSystemPrompt(params: PromptParams): BuiltSystemPrompt
// see prompt-builder.ts for the authoritative type
```

---

## 9. Tools

Tools are not part of the textual prompt. The Agent's available tools are resolved from its **toolboxes** (the DB-backed toolbox system), converted to the provider's native tool-schema shape, and passed in the LLM call's `tools` parameter. The prompt only references tools by name inside instruction blocks (e.g. "use `memorize()`", "delegate with `scout`").

The **authoritative native-tool inventory is `src/server/tools/register.ts`**. Do not maintain a hand-written tool list here; it always drifts. Every native tool is registered there with a tool name and a **family** (the third `register()` argument). The families below are derived from that file; consult it for the exact, current per-family tool set.

| Family (register arg) | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `browse` | one-shot web reads (`browse_url`, `extract_links`, `screenshot_url`, `http_request`) + stateful browser sessions (`browser_*`) |
| `search` | `web_search`, `list_search_providers` |
| `email` | list/read/search/send email + attachment download |
| `contacts` | Hivekeep CRM contacts (`get/search/create/update/delete_contact`, `set_contact_note`, `find_contact_by_identifier`) + read-only external address books (`*_address_book*`) |
| `calendar` | list/get/create/update/delete events across slug-resolved accounts |
| `voice` | TTS + STT discovery and actions (`text_to_speech`, `transcribe_audio`, list providers/voices/models) |
| `memory` | `recall`/`memorize`/`update_memory`/`forget`/`list_memories`/`review_memories`, history (`search_history`, `browse_history`, `read_message`, `list_summaries`, `read_summary`), knowledge base (`search_knowledge`, `list_knowledge_sources`) |
| `vault` | secrets (`get/create/update/delete/search_secret(s)`, `redact_message`) + vault entries/types/attachments |
| `tasks` | delegation & control (`spawn_self`, `spawn_agent`, `scout`, `respond_to_task`, `cancel_task`, `list_tasks`, `list_active_queues`, `get_task_detail`, `get_task_messages`), sub-Agent side (`report_to_parent`, `update_task_status`, `request_input`), cron learnings (`save/delete_run_learning`), human-in-the-loop (`prompt_human`, `notify`), reasoning (`think`), planning (`task_todos`) |
| `inter-agent` | `send_message`, `reply`, `list_kins` (registers `listAgentsTool`; the `list_kins` name is the registered identifier the prompt correctly matches) |
| `crons` | cron CRUD + journal/trigger + wake-up scheduler (`wake_me_in`, `wake_me_every`, `cancel_wakeup`, `list_wakeups`) |
| `projects` | projects, tags, tickets, ticket comments, ticket attachments, `start_ticket_task`, `enrich_ticket`, and project knowledge (`add/search/list/get/update/delete/pin_project_knowledge`) |
| `custom` | authoring GLOBAL custom tools (`create/write/test/update/delete_custom_tool`, `run_custom_tool_setup`, `list_custom_tools`) + tool domains |
| `images` | `generate_image`, `list_image_models`, `describe_image_model` |
| `system` | provider/model discovery, platform-config (`get_platform_logs`, `restart_platform`, `get_system_info`, …), configurator provider/default/avatar/global-prompt config, and secure-input (`request_provider_setup`, `request_channel_setup`, `prompt_secret`) |
| `mcp` | MCP server management (`add/update/remove/list_mcp_server(s)`) |
| `shell` | `run_shell` |
| `file-storage` | shareable files (`store_file`, `list_stored_files`, `search_stored_files`, `get/download/update/delete_stored_file`) |
| `agent-management` | create/update/delete/get Agents + toolbox management (`list_tools`, `list/create/update/delete_toolbox`) |
| `webhooks` | webhook CRUD |
| `channels` | external messaging (`list_channels`, `send_channel_message`, `send_to_contact`, `attach_file`, `transfer_channel`, channel CRUD/activate, `list_endpoints`, …) |
| `mini-apps` | the full mini-app builder (files, storage, snapshots/rollback, docs/templates/gallery, console/reload, backend status, icon generation, maintainer) — backends can run as background services (lifecycle hooks, local crons, notifications, permission-gated secrets/LLM/Agent access) |
| `filesystem` | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `multi_edit`, `list_directory`, `grep` |
| `database` | `execute_sql` (opt-in, God-tier) |
| `users` | `list_users`, `get_user`, `create_invitation` |

**Custom tools** are GLOBAL, exposed separately as `custom_<slug>` (resolved by `services/custom-tools.ts`, MCP-style, not in `register.ts`), and granted via toolboxes. They carry UI-only localized `translations` that never change the LLM-visible definition.

**Tool concurrency**: within an LLM step, consecutive tools flagged `concurrencySafe: true` fuse into one parallel batch (bounded by `HIVEKEEP_MAX_TOOL_USE_CONCURRENCY`, default 10); everything else runs serially. See `tool-executor.ts` and the `ToolRegistration` flags (`readOnly`, `concurrencySafe`, `destructive`).

### Sub-Agent tool scope

Sub-Agent tool availability is governed by the **toolbox system** (and scout-toolbox resolution), not by a fixed table in the prompt builder. There is no hardcoded "sub-Agents only get tools X, Y, Z" list here. Two things the builder *does* do for sub-Agents:

- It injects `## Known contacts` and a sub-Agent `## Agent directory` with inter-Agent communication instructions, so a delegated task can read contacts and message other Agents when its toolbox grants those tools.
- Project tools are surfaced for ticket-linked tasks via the `## Ticket assignment` block (project knowledge, `update_ticket`, comments, etc.).

For the exact tools a given sub-Agent can call, consult its toolbox configuration and the `defaultDisabled`/opt-in flags in `register.ts`, not this document.

---

## 10. Token budget

The system prompt competes with the message history and the response for the context window.

- Base main-Agent prompt (no project): roughly ~1500–3000 tokens depending on memories, contacts, and the instruction blocks.
- A large active project (full description + pinned knowledge) can push the stable+volatile total to ~10000 tokens (description hard-capped at `config.projects.maxDescriptionPromptTokens`, default 8000).
- Memories are bounded by `config.memory.tokenBudget` when set; the workspace tree targets ~200–500 tokens.

The compacting service triggers a new summary when the history exceeds its thresholds (see `compacting.md`), keeping the messages segment within budget while older context survives as `## Conversation history summaries`.

---

## 11. Cross-references

- `src/server/services/prompt-builder.ts`: the assembly (source of truth for block content and order).
- `src/server/services/llm-cache-hints.ts`: `buildSegmentedMessages`, how `stable`/`volatile` reach the provider and where cache breakpoints land.
- `src/server/tools/register.ts`: the live native-tool inventory (source of truth for tool names and families).
- `queenie.md`: the configurator Agent spec (mission, secure-input, avatars, onboarding flow).
- `compacting.md`: how compacting summaries (block [9]) are produced and the memory-extraction pipeline.
- `sse.md`: real-time/SSE rules (orthogonal to prompt assembly, but relevant when touching shared state).
