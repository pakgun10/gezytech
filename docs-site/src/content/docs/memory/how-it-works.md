---

Hivekeep gives each Agent persistent memory across conversations. The system uses two complementary channels: **automatic extraction** and **explicit remembering**, backed by a sophisticated hybrid search pipeline. Memories can be **private** (default, only the owning Agent can access them) or **shared** (visible and searchable by all Agents).

## Dual-Channel Architecture

### Automatic Extraction

After every LLM turn, Hivekeep runs a memory extraction pipeline that identifies facts, preferences, decisions, and knowledge from the conversation. These are stored automatically without any user action.

The extraction uses a dedicated model (configurable via `MEMORY_EXTRACTION_MODEL`) to analyze the conversation and produce structured memory entries with:

- **Category**: `fact`, `preference`, `decision`, or `knowledge`
- **Subject**: Who or what the memory is about (e.g. a contact name)
- **Source context**: A brief 1 to 2 sentence description of the conversational context in which the fact was mentioned (e.g. *"While discussing weekend plans, user mentioned..."*). This gives memories episodic flavor without a separate memory system.
- **Importance**: Score from 1 (mundane) to 10 (critical)

### Explicit Remembering

Agents have a `memorize` tool that lets them (or users) explicitly store information. This is useful for direct instructions like "Remember that I prefer dark mode" or important context the extraction pipeline might miss.

## Shared Memories

By default, memories are **private** to the Agent that created them. However, Agents can mark memories as **shared** to make them searchable by all other Agents in the instance.

### When to share

Shared memories are for information that genuinely helps other Agents: cross-domain facts (infrastructure details, user-wide preferences, project decisions affecting everyone), organizational changes, or user availability. Agents should **not** share internal reasoning, task-specific details, or domain-specific knowledge that other Agents would never need.

### How it works

- The `memorize` and `update_memory` tools accept an optional `scope` parameter: `"private"` (default) or `"shared"`
- `recall` automatically searches both private and shared memories, with shared results attributed to their author Agent (e.g. *[shared by Assistant]*)
- `list_memories` can filter by scope; `"shared"` lists shared memories from all Agents
- Deduplication checks span both scopes to prevent redundant entries
- The prompt builder adds `*[shared by Agent Name]*` attribution to shared memories injected in context

## Memory Tools

Agents have six memory tools available (main agent only):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `recall` | Semantic + keyword search across private + shared memories |
| `memorize` | Save a new memory (private or shared) |
| `update_memory` | Update content, category, subject, or scope |
| `forget` | Delete an outdated or incorrect memory |
| `list_memories` | List memories, filtered by subject, category, or scope |
| `review_memories` | LLM-powered audit that detects contradictions, duplicates, stale entries, and clutter |

Both `recall` and `list_memories` include conversational provenance: when a memory has a `sourceContext` (the context in which it was learned), it's included in the result. Shared memories also include `authorAgentName` attribution.

## Storage

Memories are stored as vector embeddings using an embedding provider (OpenAI, Voyage, Jina, etc.) in a SQLite database with two search indexes:

- **sqlite-vec**: KNN vector index for semantic similarity
- **FTS5**: Full-text search index for keyword matching

## Retrieval Pipeline

When an Agent needs relevant memories (either via the `recall` tool or automatic injection at conversation start), Hivekeep runs a multi-stage pipeline:

### 1. Contextual Query Rewriting

Short or ambiguous messages (e.g. "yes", "what about that?") are rewritten into standalone queries using recent conversation context. This prevents poor retrieval on follow-up messages that only make sense in context.

Controlled by `MEMORY_CONTEXTUAL_REWRITE_MODEL`, disabled by default.

### 2. Multi-Query Expansion

If enabled, the query is expanded into 3 alternative formulations using an LLM. Each variation targets a different aspect, entity, or sub-topic to maximize recall. The system provides known memory subjects to help generate targeted, entity-specific queries.

Controlled by `MEMORY_MULTI_QUERY_MODEL`, disabled by default.

### 3. Hybrid Search (Vector + FTS)

For each query (original + variations), two searches run in parallel:

- **Vector similarity**: KNN search via sqlite-vec, filtered by a cosine similarity threshold
- **Full-text search**: FTS5 with prefix matching, AND-first with OR fallback

### 4. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Results from both search methods (across all query variations) are merged using RRF scoring:

```
score = Σ (boost / (K + rank + 1))
```

Where `K` is a smoothing constant (default 60) and FTS results get an optional boost factor (default 1.2×).

### 5. Score Weighting

Fused scores are weighted by multiple factors:

- **Temporal decay**: Older memories decay based on category. Facts/knowledge decay very slowly; decisions decay faster. Controlled by `MEMORY_TEMPORAL_DECAY_LAMBDA`.
- **Importance**: Higher importance memories get proportionally higher scores
- **Retrieval frequency**: Memories retrieved more often get a mild logarithmic boost (the system finds them useful)
- **Subject matching**: If the query mentions a known memory subject, those memories get a boost (default 1.3×)
- **Recency boost**: Very recent memories get an extra multiplier: ×1.5 for today, ×1.25 for this week, ×1.1 for this month. Enabled by default, disable with `MEMORY_RECENCY_BOOST=false`
- **Category boost**: Memories matching a detected category in the query get a configurable multiplier (default 1.2×, set via `MEMORY_CATEGORY_BOOST`)

### 6. Re-ranking (Optional)

If enabled via `MEMORY_RERANK_MODEL`, top candidates are re-ranked for relevance. Hivekeep supports two re-ranking strategies:

1. **Cross-encoder rerank (preferred)**: If a provider with `rerank` capability is configured (Cohere or Jina), Hivekeep calls their dedicated rerank API. Cross-encoders are ~20× faster and ~10× cheaper than LLM rerankers with comparable accuracy.
2. **LLM-based rerank (fallback)**: If no rerank provider is available, an LLM scores each memory's relevance on a 0-10 scale. The LLM score becomes the primary ranking signal, with the hybrid score as tiebreaker.

The system tries cross-encoder first and falls back to LLM automatically. Controlled by `MEMORY_RERANK_MODEL`, disabled by default.

### 7. Adaptive K

Instead of returning a fixed number of results, Adaptive K trims the result list based on score distribution:

- Results below a minimum score ratio of the top result are dropped
- If there's a steep score drop between consecutive results (a "cliff"), the list is truncated there

This ensures only genuinely relevant memories are injected, avoiding noise. Enabled by default.

## Retrieval Tracking

Every time memories are injected into an Agent's context, their retrieval count and timestamp are updated. This data feeds into:

- **Retrieval frequency boost** during search scoring
- **Importance recalibration**: a periodic process that nudges importance scores based on retrieval patterns (frequently retrieved = bump up, never retrieved after 30+ days = slight decrease)

## Memory Consolidation

When enabled, Hivekeep periodically consolidates similar memories to reduce redundancy:

1. **Pair detection**: memories with cosine similarity above the threshold (default `0.85`) are flagged as candidates
2. **Clustering**: overlapping pairs are grouped into clusters, capped at **3 memories per cluster** to avoid information loss in large merges (larger clusters are split and handled across multiple runs)
3. **LLM merge**: each cluster is sent to an LLM that either merges them into a single richer memory or **aborts** if the memories are about genuinely different topics (preventing false merges)
4. **Quality guardrails**: the LLM preserves all unique details, picks the most appropriate category/subject, and keeps the highest importance rating from the sources

Consolidation is disabled by default. Enable it by setting `MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_MODEL` to a model identifier. See [configuration](/docs/memory/configuration/#memory-consolidation) for all settings.

## Stale Memory Pruning

After importance recalibration runs during compacting, Hivekeep automatically prunes memories that have decayed to very low importance and are never retrieved. This completes the importance lifecycle: extraction → recalibration → pruning.

The pruning is purely heuristic-based, no LLM calls needed:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Importance ≤ 1, never retrieved | Older than **60 days** |
| Importance ≤ 2, never retrieved | Older than **90 days** |

Pruned memories are permanently deleted. The number of pruned memories is recorded in the compacting system message metadata alongside extraction and consolidation counts.

## Session Compacting

When conversations grow long, Hivekeep automatically **compacts** them using **token-aware multi-summary accumulation**:

1. After each LLM turn, the system checks if context usage exceeds a configurable threshold (`COMPACTING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`, default: **75%** of the model's context window)
2. A **keep-window** preserves recent messages that fit within `COMPACTING_KEEP_PERCENT` (default: 40%) of the context window as raw context
3. Everything before the keep-window is summarized into a **new dated summary**. Summaries accumulate chronologically, never overwrite
4. When summaries exceed the budget (`COMPACTING_MAX_SUMMARIES` or `COMPACTING_SUMMARY_BUDGET_PERCENT`), the oldest merge **telescopically** into higher-level summaries marked `[compressed]`

Before compacting runs, a **progressive context pipeline** reduces in-memory context size without any LLM calls:
- **Intact zone**: Recent tool results kept in full
- **Observation zone**: Middle-aged tool results truncated
- **Collapsed zone**: Oldest tool results collapsed to one-line summaries

Users can **force compact** from the UI at any time. All compaction results and errors are persisted in the conversation history, with real-time progress via SSE events. Compacting is fully configurable **per-Agent** (threshold, keep window, summary budget, max summaries, model).

## Data Flow

```
User message
  → Contextual rewrite (if short/ambiguous)
  → Multi-query expansion (if enabled)
  → Hybrid search (vector + FTS) per query
  → RRF fusion → score weighting → re-rank → adaptive K
  → Relevant memories injected into Agent context with prioritization guidance
  → LLM processes and responds
  → Extraction pipeline analyzes the turn
  → New memories stored as embeddings
  → Retrieval counts updated

Compacting cycle (after each LLM turn):
  → Progressive context pipeline (tool masking + observation compaction)
  → Token-percentage check → keep-window summarization if threshold exceeded
  → New summary added (accumulates chronologically)
  → Extract new memories from compacted batch
  → Consolidate similar memories
  → Recalibrate importance scores
  → Prune stale memories (low importance, never retrieved, old)
  → Telescopic merge if summaries exceed budget or count
```
