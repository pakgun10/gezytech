description: Configure memory extraction, retrieval, search pipeline, and compacting behavior.
---

Memory behavior is controlled through environment variables. All settings have sensible defaults. The advanced search features (multi-query, re-ranking, contextual rewrite) are disabled by default and can be enabled by setting their respective model variables.

## Core Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEMORY_EXTRACTION_MODEL` | Provider default | Model used for automatic memory extraction after each turn |
| `MEMORY_MAX_RELEVANT` | `10` | Maximum relevant memories injected into context per turn |
| `MEMORY_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | `0.7` | Minimum cosine similarity for vector search results (0-1) |
| `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | Embedding model for memory vectors |
| `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` | `1536` | Vector dimension for embeddings |

## Search Pipeline Settings

These control the hybrid search, scoring, and result selection pipeline.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEMORY_RRF_K` | `60` | Reciprocal Rank Fusion smoothing constant. Higher values give more weight to lower-ranked results |
| `MEMORY_FTS_BOOST` | `1.2` | Multiplier for FTS results in RRF scoring. Values > 1 favor keyword matches |
| `MEMORY_SUBJECT_BOOST` | `1.3` | Score multiplier when a memory's subject matches an entity in the query |
| `MEMORY_CATEGORY_BOOST` | `1.25` | Score multiplier for category-matching memories |
| `MEMORY_TEMPORAL_DECAY_LAMBDA` | `0.01` | Temporal decay rate. Higher = faster decay. Set to `0` to disable. Category-adjusted: facts decay 10× slower than decisions |
| `MEMORY_TEMPORAL_DECAY_FLOOR` | `0.7` | Minimum score multiplier from temporal decay. Prevents old memories from being completely suppressed |
| `MEMORY_TOKEN_BUDGET` | `0` | Max tokens for the memory block in prompt. `0` = unlimited (no budget enforcement) |
| `MEMORY_RECENCY_BOOST` | `true` | Enable recency-based score boost (×1.5 today, ×1.25 this week, ×1.1 this month). Set to `false` to disable |
| `MEMORY_ADAPTIVE_K` | `true` | Enable adaptive result trimming based on score distribution |
| `MEMORY_ADAPTIVE_K_MIN_SCORE_RATIO` | `0.3` | Minimum score as a ratio of the top result. Results below this are dropped |

## Optional LLM Enhancements

These features use additional LLM calls to improve retrieval quality. Each is disabled by default (no model set). Set a model name to enable.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEMORY_MULTI_QUERY_MODEL` | *(disabled)* | Model for generating query variations. Expands each query into 3 alternatives targeting different aspects |
| `MEMORY_HYDE_MODEL` | *(disabled)* | Model for HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding). Generates a hypothetical answer to use as an additional search query for better semantic matching |
| `MEMORY_RERANK_MODEL` | *(disabled)* | Model for re-ranking. If a rerank provider (Cohere/Jina) is configured, uses their cross-encoder API (~20× faster). Otherwise falls back to LLM-based scoring (0-10 scale) |
| `MEMORY_CONTEXTUAL_REWRITE_MODEL` | *(disabled)* | Model for rewriting short/ambiguous messages into standalone queries using conversation context |
| `MEMORY_CONTEXTUAL_REWRITE_THRESHOLD` | `80` | Character length threshold. Messages shorter than this are candidates for contextual rewriting |

:::tip
For LLM enhancement models, use a fast/cheap model (e.g. `gpt-4.1-mini`) since they run on every retrieval. The quality gain comes from the technique, not the model size.

## Memory Consolidation

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_MODEL` | *(disabled)* | Model for memory consolidation (merging similar memories) |
| `MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_SIMILARITY` | `0.85` | Cosine similarity threshold for considering two memories as candidates for consolidation |
| `MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_GEN` | `5` | Maximum number of consolidated memories generated per run |

Consolidation clusters are capped at 3 memories to preserve detail. Larger groups are split and merged incrementally across runs. The LLM can also abort a merge if it determines the memories are about different topics.

## Compacting Settings

Session compacting uses **token-aware multi-summary accumulation**: when context usage exceeds a configurable threshold, older messages outside a keep-window are summarized into dated summaries that stack chronologically. When summaries accumulate beyond the budget, the oldest merge telescopically.

### Token-based trigger

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COMPACTING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` | `75` | Context usage % before compaction triggers |
| `COMPACTING_KEEP_PERCENT` | `40` | % of context window preserved as raw messages (keep-window) |
| `COMPACTING_SUMMARY_BUDGET_PERCENT` | `20` | Max % of context window for summary tokens before telescopic merge |
| `COMPACTING_MAX_SUMMARIES` | `10` | Max active summaries before telescopic merge |
| `COMPACTING_MAX_SUMMARIES_PER_KIN` | `50` | Total summary retention per Agent (active + archived) |

### General settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COMPACTING_MODEL` | Provider default | Model used for session compacting/summarization. Supports `providerId:modelId` format |

All compacting settings can be configured **per-Agent** (overrides global values) via the **Compaction** tab in the Agent's settings. Available per-Agent fields: `thresholdPercent`, `keepPercent`, `summaryBudgetPercent`, `maxSummaries`, `compactingModel`, and `compactingProviderId`.

### Progressive context pipeline

Before compacting runs, Hivekeep applies a progressive pipeline to reduce context size without LLM calls:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOOL_RESULT_MASK_KEEP_LAST` | `2` | Number of recent tool call groups kept fully intact. Older groups are collapsed to one-line summaries |
| `OBSERVATION_COMPACTION_WINDOW` | `10` | Number of recent turns kept at full resolution. Older turns have tool results truncated. `0` = disabled |
| `OBSERVATION_MAX_CHARS` | `200` | Max characters for truncated tool results in the observation zone |
| `HISTORY_TOKEN_BUDGET` | `0` (disabled) | Emergency safety net: max tokens for conversation history. Messages trimmed from oldest end if exceeded. `0` = no limit |

### Tool output spill

Large tool results are automatically spilled to temporary files instead of being included inline in the LLM context:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOOL_OUTPUT_SPILL_THRESHOLD` | `10000` | Byte threshold before spilling to file. `0` = disabled |
| `TOOL_OUTPUT_PREVIEW_LINES` | `200` | Lines included in the compact preview reference |
| `TOOL_OUTPUT_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | Hours before spilled files are cleaned up |

## Embedding Provider

Memory requires an **embedding provider** to be configured in **Settings > Providers**. Built-in embedding providers:

- **OpenAI**: `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002`
- **OpenAI-compatible**: any endpoint exposing `/v1/embeddings`, via a custom base URL and an optional API key. This is how you run **fully local embeddings**: point it at Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`, `qwen3-embedding`, `embeddinggemma`, …), llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, LiteLLM, or NewAPI. Model names are free-form (no `text-embedding-*` restriction) and the vector dimension is detected automatically.

Other embedding sources (Voyage, Jina, Cohere, Mistral, …) ship as **plugins**.

:::caution
Without an embedding provider, memory storage and retrieval will not work. The Agent will still function but won't remember anything across sessions.

## Tuning Tips

### Basic Tuning
- **Lower `MEMORY_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`** (e.g., 0.5) to retrieve more memories at the cost of relevance
- **Raise `MEMORY_MAX_RELEVANT`** if your Agent needs broader context awareness
- **Lower `COMPACTING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`** (e.g., 60) for earlier compaction triggers
- **Raise `COMPACTING_KEEP_PERCENT`** (e.g., 50) to keep more raw context visible to the LLM

### Search Quality
- **Enable multi-query** (`MEMORY_MULTI_QUERY_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini`) for better recall on complex queries
- **Enable re-ranking** (`MEMORY_RERANK_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini`) for better precision when you have many memories
- **Enable contextual rewrite** (`MEMORY_CONTEXTUAL_REWRITE_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini`) if your users send lots of short follow-up messages
- **Increase `MEMORY_FTS_BOOST`** (e.g., 1.5) if keyword matching should matter more than semantic similarity

### Performance
- Use a **faster/cheaper model** for `MEMORY_EXTRACTION_MODEL` since it runs on every turn
- LLM enhancements (multi-query, re-rank, rewrite) each add one LLM call per retrieval. Enable selectively based on your needs
- **Disable temporal decay** (`MEMORY_TEMPORAL_DECAY_LAMBDA=0`) if all memories should be treated equally regardless of age
