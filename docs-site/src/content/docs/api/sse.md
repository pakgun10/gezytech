title: SSE Events
description: Real-time Server-Sent Events for live UI updates.
---

Hivekeep uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to push real-time updates to the web UI. Connect to the SSE endpoint to receive live notifications about changes.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/sse
```

Requires authentication. Returns a `text/event-stream` response.

## Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connected**: Server sends a `connected` event with a `connectionId`
2. **Ping**: Server sends `ping` events every 15 seconds to keep the connection alive
3. **Events**: Real-time events are delivered as `message` events with JSON data
4. **Disconnect**: Client closes the connection; server cleans up automatically

## Event Format

Each event is a JSON object with a `type` field and contextual fields:

```json
{
  "type": "event-type",
  "agentId": "optional-agent-id",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

| `update:finished` | Self-update outcome (`{ runId, status: 'success' \| 'failed' \| 'rolled-back', version?, error? }`). `success`/`rolled-back` are emitted after the restart, so clients should also poll `GET /api/version-check/last-update` while SSE reconnects | Broadcast |

### Other resource events

Most CRUD resources also broadcast `created` / `updated` / `deleted` events so any open tab stays in sync. Beyond the families above, these include: `agent` (plus `agent:active-project`, `agent:read`), `provider`, `mcp-server`, `contact`, `cron`, `webhook`, `memory`, `custom-tool`, `toolbox`, `tool-domain`, `email-account`, `connected-account`, `project`, `project-tag`, and `ticket` (plus `ticket:comment-added` / `comment-updated` / `comment-deleted`). The canonical, exhaustive list of event names lives in `src/server/sse/types.ts`.

## Delivery Scope

Events are delivered based on scope:

- **Broadcast**: Sent to all connected clients (provider changes, MCP updates, settings)
- **Per-Agent**: Sent to clients viewing a specific Agent (chat, memories, compacting, reactions)
- **Per-User**: Sent to a specific user's connections (notifications)

## Client Usage

```javascript
const evtSource = new EventSource('/api/sse', {
  withCredentials: true
})

evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)

  switch (data.type) {
    case 'chat:token':
      // Append streaming token to UI
      appendToken(data.data.token)
      break
    case 'chat:done':
      // Finalize message display
      finalizeMessage()
      break
    case 'miniapp:updated':
      // Refresh mini-app data
      refreshMiniApp(data.data.app)
      break
  }
}

evtSource.onerror = () => {
  // EventSource auto-reconnects
  console.log('SSE connection lost, reconnecting...')
}
```
